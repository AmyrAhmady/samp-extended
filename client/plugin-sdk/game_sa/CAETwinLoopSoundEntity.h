/* This class is used to control 2 sounds as one. There are 2 sounds
   created with PlayTwinLoopSound(), and one of them is playing when second
   is simply muted. When time m_dwTimeToSwapSounds is reached, these sounds
   are switched: second starts playing, first begins being muted.
   The time m_dwTimeToSwapSounds is calcualated as:
   CAEAudioUtility::GetRandomNumberInRange(m_wPlayTimeMin, m_wPlayTimeMax);
   Notice these sounds must be situated in same bank slot.
   m_pBaseAudio is a pointer to audio which created twin sound. For example,
   this could be CAEVehicleAudioEntity for playing skid sounds.              */
